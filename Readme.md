## Problem Statement
- Make a static player with play/pause control (no need of fast forward or audio control)
- The bars height and direction can be random but need to have a maximum height.
- Play Button Click:Audio should play and start moving the audio player.
- Also click anywhere on the player and it should move to the exact time of the audio(like in the video above).
- Add static tags exactly as shown in the above video.
- Pause Button Click : Should stop playing the audio.

## Tech Stacks
** JavaScript **
** HTML/Canvas **


## Approach
- Initially i tried to implement a slider over audio tag.
- Once audio slider finished i started working on canvas and tried to fetch the position of mousedown and send it to audio slider.
- After audio slider first i tried to make canvas with multiple layers but later to optimize the app i did the task over one canvas only.
- Later i worked on static bars and tags.
- After this i did Testing for app at multiple steps.
